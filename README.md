## Course Notes

### NestJS Modules

- Each application has ar leat one module â€“ the root module. That is the starting point of the application.
- Modules are an effective way to organize components by a closely related set of capabilities (e.g. per feature).
- It is a good practice to have a folder per module, containing the module's components.
- Modules are **singletons**, therefore, a module can be imported by multople other modules.

A module is defined by annotating a class with the `@Module` decorator. The decorator provides metadata that NestJS uses to organize the application structure.

```ts
@Module()
export class AppModule {}
```

#### Properties

- **`providers`:** Array of providers to be available within the module via dependency injection.
- **`controllers`:** Array of controllers to be instantiated within the module.
- **`exports`:** Array of providers to export to other modules.
- **`imports`:** List of modules required by this module. Any exported provider by these modules will now be available in our module via dependency injection.

Example:

```ts
@Module({
  providers: [ForumService],
  controllers: [ForumController],
  imports: [
    PostModule,
    CommentModule,
    AuthModule
  ],
  exports: [
    ForumService
  ]
})
export class ForumModule {}
```

### NestJS Controllers

- Responsible for handling incoming **requests** and returning **responses** to the client.
- Bound to a specific **path** (for exampel `/tasks` for the task resource).
- Contain **handlers**, which handle **endpoints** and **request methods** (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
- Can take advantage of **dependency injection** to consume providers within the same module.

Controllers are defined by decorating a class with the `@Controller` decorator. The decorator accepts a string, which is the **path** to be handled by the controller.

```ts
@Controller('/tasks')
export class TaskController {}
```

#### Handlers

Handlers are simply methods within the controller class, decorated with decorators such as `@Get`, `@Post`, etc.

```ts
@Controller('/tasks')
export class TaskController {
  @Get()
  all() {
    // Do stuff.
  }

  @Post()
  store() {
    // Do stuff.
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Request Flow

1. The request is routed to a controller, and a handler is called with arguments.
  - NestJS will parse the relevant request data and it will be available in the handler.
2. Handler handles the request.
  - Perform operations such as communication with a service. For example, retrieving an item from the database.
3. Handler returns a response value.
  - The response can be of any type and even an exception. NestJS will wrap the returned value as an HTTP response and return it to the client.

### NestJS Providers

- Can be injected into constructors if decorated as an `@Injectable`, via **dependency injection**.
- Can be a plain value, a class, sync/async factory, etc.
- Providers must be provided to a module for them to be usable.
- Can be exported from a module, and then be available to other modules that import it.

#### Services

- Defined as providers. **Not all providers are services**.
- Common concept within software development and are not exclusive NestJS, JavaScript, or backend development
- Singleton when wrapped with `@Injectable` and provided to a module. That means, the same instance will be shared across the application, acting as a single source of truth.
- The main source of business logic. For example, a service will be called from a controller to validate data, create an item in the database, and return a response.

```ts
import { TasksController } from './tasks.controller';
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service';
import { LoggerService } from '../shared/logger.service';

@Module({
  controllers: [TasksController],
  providers: [
    TasksService,
    LoggerService,
  ],
})
export class TasksModule {}
```

#### Dependency Injection in NestJS

Any component within the NestJS ecosystem can inhect a provider that is decorated with `@Injectable`.

We define the dependencies in the constructor of the class. NestJS will take care of the injection for us, and it will then be available as a class property.

```ts
import { TasksService } from './tasks.service';

@Controller('/tasks')
export class TasksController {
  constructor(private tasksService: TaskService) {

    @Get()
    async all() {
      return await this.tasksService.all();
    }
  }
}
```

## Data Transfer Object (DTO)

A DTO is an object that carries data between processes. It is used to encapsulate data and send it from one subsystem of an application to another. In NestJS, it is meant to be an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network.

- Common concept in software development that is not specific to NestJS.
- Result in more bulletproof code, as it can be used as a TypeScript type.
- Do not have any behavior except for storage, retrieval, serialization, and deserialization of its own data.
- Result in increased performance (altough negligible in small applications).
- Can be used for data validation.
- It is **not** a model definition. It defines the shape of data for a specific case, for example - creating a task.
- Can be defined using an `interface` or a `class`.
- They are not mandatory, you can develop applications without DTOs, however, the value they add makes it worthwhile to use them when applicable.
- Applying the DTO pattern as soon as possible will make it easy for you to maintain and refactor your code.

### Classes vs. Interfaces

- The recommended approach is to use **classes**, also clearly documented in the NestJS documentation.
- The reason is that interfaces are part of the TypeScript specification and therefore are not preserved post-compilation.
- Classes allow us to do more, and since they are part of JavaScript, they will be preserved post-compilation.
- NestJS cannot refer to interfaces in run-time, but can refer to classes.

## NestJS Pipes

- Pipes operate on the **arguments** to be processed by the route handler just before the handler is called.
- Pipes can perform **data transformation** or **data validation**.
- Pipes can return data, either original or modified, which will be passed on to the route handler.
- Pipes can throw exceptions. Exceptions thrown will be handled by NestJS and parsed into an error response.
- Pipes can be asynchronous.

### Default NestJS Pipes

_Part of the `@nestjs/common` module._

#### ValidationPipe

Validates the compatibility of an entire object against a class (goes well with [DTOs](#data-transfer-object-dto)). If any property cannot be mapped properly (for example, mismatching type), the validation will fail.

#### ParseIntPipe

By default, arguments are of the type `String`. This pipe validates that an argument is a number. If successful, the argument is transformed into a `Number` and passed on to the handler.

### Custom Pipes

- Pipes are classes annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator.
- Pipes must implement the `PipeTransform` generic interface. Therefore, every pipe must have a `transform()` method. This will be called by NestJS to process the arguments.
- The `transform()` method accepts 2 parameters:
  - **`value`:** The value of the processed argument.
  - **`metadata`:** An optional object containing metadata about the argument.
- Whatever is returned from the `transform()` method will be passed on to the route handler. Exceptions will be sent back to the client.

### Consuming Pipes

#### Handler-level Pipes

Defined at the handler level, via the `@UsePipes()` decorator. Such pipe will process all parameters for the incoming requests.

In relation to [parameter-level pipes](#parameter-level-pipes) these require some more code, but provide some great benefits:

- Do not require extra code at the parameter level
- Easier to maintain and expand. If the shape of the data changes, it is easy to make the necessary changes within the pipe only.
- Responsibility of identifying the arguments to process is shifted to one central file, the pipe itself.
- Promote usage of DTOs

```ts
@Post()
@UsePipes(SomePipe)
createTask(@Body('description') description: string) {
  // ...
}
```

#### Parameter-level Pipes

Defined at the parameter level. Only the specific parameter for which the pipe has been specified will be processed. This type of pipe tends to be slimmer and cleaner. Howeverm they often result in extra code added to handlers, this can get messy and hard to maintain.

```ts
@Post()
createTask(@Body('description', SomePipe) description: string) {
  // ...
}
```

#### Global Pipes

Defined at the application level and will be applied to any incoming request.

```ts
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(ApplicationModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(SomePipe);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

## Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

ORM is a technique that lets you query and manupulate data from a database, using an object-oriented paradigm.

There are many ORM libraries that allow developers to communicate to the database using their preferred programming language, rather than sending plain queries directly.

### Pros

- Writing the data mnodel in one place makes it easier to maintain because it is less repetition.
- Lots of things done automatically: database handling, data types, relations, etc.
- No need to write SQL syntax (easy to learn, hard to master), lets you use your natural way of coding.
- Database abstraction, lets you change the database type whenever you wish.
- Leverages OOP, therefore things like inheritance are easy to achieve

### Cons

- You have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not always simple.
- Performance is decent, but easy to neglect.
- Makes it easy to forget (or never learn) what's happening behind the scenes, which can lead to a variety of maintainability issues.

### TypeORM

Is an ORM library that can run in Node.js and be used with TypeScript (also JavaScript). It helps us define and manage entities, repositories, columns, relations, replication, indices, queries, logging, and so much more.

```ts
const tasks = await Task.find({ status: 'DONE', user: 'Ashley' });
```
